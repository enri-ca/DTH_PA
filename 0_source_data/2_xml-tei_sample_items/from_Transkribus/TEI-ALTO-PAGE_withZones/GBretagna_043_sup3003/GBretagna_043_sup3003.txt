HERMES
Formerly in the Collection of
The Earl of Aberdeen


267


British Museum. 
This head came from Lord Aberdeen's collection and 
was formerly called that of a young Hercules. 
In 1886 Wolters discovered that it was Praxitelean. 
Miss Sellers put it by the side of the head of the Hermes 
of Olympia and found them amazingly similar. 
The head is of finest Parian marble and has holes 
in the hair for a wreath. Lechat says that it
is brother to the Sphinx of the Akropolis Museum
