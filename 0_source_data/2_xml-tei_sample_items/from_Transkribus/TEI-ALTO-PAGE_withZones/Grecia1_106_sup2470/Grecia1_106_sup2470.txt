This is the fine tower built in the 13thcentury by the Frank Dukes
of Athens on the southern wing of the Propylea. I saw it in 1865.
Some 15 years after, it was destroyed by Greeck pedantry, Schliemann
assisting with a subscription. When Stuart saw it in 1752 it was
used by the Turks as a prison.


It was the keep of the fortified palace of these dukes and is if
the same age as the tower of Marco Sanudo in the citadel of Naxos
and of that of Santonieri (Nicolas de St. Omer) at Phebes say between
1250 and 1300. 


It rose to a height of 85 feet above its base, which base was 45 feet
below the stylobate of the Parthenon.


The top of the tower was not so high as the roof of the Parthenon, but 
36 feet above the highest point of the Akropolis road. 


It was far long; 28 1/2 feet long from East to West and 25 1/2 feet wide 
from North to South. The walls were 5 3/4 ft thick. They consisted of 
51 layers of big marble stones from the old monements, each 
layer being above 10 inches in thickness. 


On the towers North face, high up was a square tourelle putting 
out and terminating in a vault and a terrace in which the 
Turks had placed 2 small canons. The entrance was at the 
vert facing Nike Anteros; the stairs inside were of wood.
