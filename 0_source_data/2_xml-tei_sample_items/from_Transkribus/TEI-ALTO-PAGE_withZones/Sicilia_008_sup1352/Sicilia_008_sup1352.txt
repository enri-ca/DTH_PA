PALERMO Sarcofago 
 G. Sommer - Napoli


All these sarch. and turns are of alabaster and 
come from Chiusi. The town of Palermo bought 
the Casuccini collection in 1866. 


The relief of the big sarc. represents the farewell of a married pair. 
He is Lavth Aphuna, she Aphunei who reclines covered with jewelry 
on the lid of the sarc. Awreiged female demon leads her off to the 
shades below, while her daughter Thanch (Tanaquit) tries to console 
her old father. Others of the family are standing about. 
On the extreme left a fate, called Culice is coming out of the portal 
of Death. See Dennis Vol II. page 316.
