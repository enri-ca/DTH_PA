67. - PALERMO 
TOMBA DI COSTANZA 
G. INCORPORA, PALERMO 


The sarcophagus is of solid porphyry; the six supporting columns 
of the baldachino are inlaid with gold mosaics; at the head 
of the sarc. an imperial crown in relief, below it a cross patonce 
inscribed in a circle; at the rear, above a rosette, below a 
single headed eagle. 
An old, but contemporary inscription said:


Caesaris Henrici latet hic Constantia corpus 
undeno lustro hac platea rugosa sacerdos 
Facta dedis parta Fredericum Augusta secundum 
To meritis sacratam tenes sic ossa Panhormus, 
Vix. Au LX1. Ubiis MCCIII. M.2. 
She died in fact in 1198 aged 44. 
See Villani for the myth about her. 


The impress Constantia II, the wife of stupor mundi, she died at Catania 
in 1222, is also buried here, with her was interred a lot of jewels, rings, 
collars, diadem etc. There, when her tomb was opened in the past century 
were found in a box other feet together with a lamina with an 
inscription in rude Latin, but quite legible. She wore garments of 
Saracenic art. I saw some of these remains in the sacristy of 
the Duomo in 1892.
