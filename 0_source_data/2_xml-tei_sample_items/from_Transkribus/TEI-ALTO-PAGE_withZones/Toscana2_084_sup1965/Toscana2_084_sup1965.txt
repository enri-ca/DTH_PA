This painted terra cotta Etruscan lady, Larthia Seianti S... (of the family 
of Sejanus) was discovered at Chiusi in 1877, brought to Rome and placed 
in the Kircherian in 1878 and then removed to the Museum at Florence, 
where she now is. She wears a quantity of jewelry: a fillet of flowers with 
rubies and emeralds; a girdle studded with rubies; an emerald clasp to her 
golden sandals; earrings; a necklace; a brooch with a Medusa's head; 
a bracelet and an amulet; and rings in plenty on her left hand in which 
she holds a mirror set in a framework of gold. 
The date of this monument is said to be 217 B.C. 
It cost the Government 10,000 fes. only.
