Assisi. 
Monument of Hecuba de Lusignan, Queen of Cyprus. 
Said to have been made by Fuccio Fiorentino about 1240. 
Mr. Perkins thinks that the tomb was made probably 
by Lapo, one of Nicol√≤ Pisanos scholars. 


It is thought now (1898) that the tomb is that of Maria, princess of 
Antioch, daughter of John of Brieune, king of Jerusalem. He died at Constantinople 
in 1237 and in 1268 she made over her right to his Kingdom to Carl of Ansor. 
The arms on the tomb are those of Jerusalem.
